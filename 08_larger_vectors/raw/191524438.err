--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[45360,0],0] on node eu-ms-006-14
  Remote daemon: [[45360,0],1] on node eu-ms-008-34

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
